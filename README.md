# UCUG 1505 Design Diary

##Oct.28
In today’s creative coding lesson, we shared our thoughts to our classmates about our initial ideas. And I am writing this report to clarify the gains from the interactions. 

The gains is mainly about detailing the specific product we are going to bring about. Actually we are vague about the inputs and outputs. And through the discussion we have a new thought of how to place the pressure sensors on balls, how to present the visual content, what kinds of sounds we would like to make and which path we would like to map.

1.The overall logic of our work:

2.Topics for us to explore and discuss:
(1)Ball: material, texture, size, 
(2)Sensors: how much? And if the data collected differs how can us deal with the gap, because the whole process probably is not in equilibrium
(3)Mapping logic: we still need to refer to some successful works to give us the inspiration or some theoretical basic
(4)Dimensions to take advantage of the data collected by the sensors (the frequency the changing rate, and the crushing time are somewhat a little bit overlap)
(5)Specific ways to make a vivid visual effect, especially to switch it into various shapes naturally
(maybe you still use AI to make it more achievable tonight!)
There is still much for us to explore! And rather than complicated codes, what counts in the end is the effect!!!
